# AWS Unified Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a unified AWS-first file management system across all roles (Admin, Educator, Student) with shared data access, educator selection functionality, and fixed file operations.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Unified AWS-First API Service ✅

**File: `client/src/services/unified-api.ts`**

All roles now use the same AWS services with intelligent fallbacks:

```typescript
// AWS-first approach for all file operations
files = {
  getAll: async () => {
    try {
      // Try AWS first for all roles
      const response = await axios.get('https://ps30ghdj7f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/files', {
        headers: {
          'X-User-Role': this.userRole,
          'X-User-Id': this.userId,
        },
      });
      return response;
    } catch (awsError) {
      // Fallback to local API
      return this.apiClient.get('/files');
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- All roles share the same file data source
- Seamless fallback to local storage if AWS unavailable
- Role-based filtering maintained at AWS level
- Consistent data across admin, educator, and student views

### 2. Enhanced Educator File Upload with Lecturer Selection ✅

**File: `client/src/components/FileUpload.tsx`**

**Features Added:**
- Dynamic lecturer dropdown populated from user database
- Filters to show only users with 'educator' role
- Real-time lecturer list loading from unified API
- Proper educator context for file uploads

```typescript
const loadLecturers = async () => {
  const response = await apiService.users.getAll();
  const educatorUsers = response.data.filter(user => user.role === 'educator');
  setLecturers(educatorUsers);
};
```

**UI Enhancement:**
- Dropdown shows: "Title Name Surname"
- Validates lecturer selection before upload
- Uses unified API service for both user fetching and file upload

### 3. Fixed Educator File Delete & Download Operations ✅

**Client-Side Fixes (`client/src/views/EducatorView.tsx`):**

**Delete Function:**
```typescript
const handleFileDelete = async (fileId: string) => {
  await apiService.files.delete(fileId);
  loadFiles(); // Reload to get updated list from AWS
};
```

**Download Function:**
```typescript
const handleFileDownload = async (fileId: string, fileName: string) => {
  const response = await apiService.files.download(fileId);
  
  // Handle both direct blob and AWS pre-signed URLs
  if (response.data instanceof Blob) {
    // Direct blob download
    const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(response.data);
    // ... trigger download
  } else if (response.data.downloadUrl) {
    // AWS pre-signed URL
    window.open(response.data.downloadUrl, '_blank');
  }
};
```

**Server-Side Fixes (`server/server.js`):**

**Enhanced Delete Endpoint:**
```javascript
app.delete('/api/files/:fileId', validateAccess, async (req, res) => {
  // AWS-first deletion with local backup cleanup
  const awsResponse = await callAWSAPI('DELETE', `/files/${fileId}`);
  
  // Remove from local backup
  const localFiles = await readJsonFile(FILES_FILE);
  const localIndex = localFiles.findIndex(f => f.fileId === fileId || f.awsId === fileId);
  if (localIndex !== -1) {
    localFiles.splice(localIndex, 1);
    await writeJsonFile(FILES_FILE, localFiles);
  }
});
```

### 4. Shared Data Architecture ✅

**All Roles Use Same AWS Endpoints:**

| Role | Files Endpoint | Users Endpoint | Behavior |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Admin | `GET /dev/files` | `GET /dev/users` | See all data |
| Educator | `GET /dev/files` | `GET /dev/users` | See own files + all educators |
| Student | `GET /dev/files` | `GET /dev/users` | See module files + associated educators |

**Role-Based Filtering:**
- **Server-Side**: AWS/Local APIs filter data based on `X-User-Role` header
- **Client-Side**: Additional filtering for UI-specific needs
- **Data Consistency**: All roles see the same base dataset, filtered appropriately

### 5. Preserved AWS Chat URL ✅

**Original URL Maintained:**
```
https://ps30ghdj7f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/chat
```

**Integration:**
- Chat operations preserved with original URL
- File operations use same domain with `/dev/files` endpoints
- User operations use same domain with `/dev/users` endpoints
- Unified authentication headers across all AWS services

## Updated Component Architecture

### Student View Enhanced
```typescript
// Now shows associated educators and their files
const [educators, setEducators] = useState<User[]>([]);
const [selectedEducator, setSelectedEducator] = useState<User | null>(null);

// Educator selection functionality
const handleEducatorSelect = async (educator: User) => {
  const filesResponse = await apiService.files.getByEducator(educator.id);
  setFiles(filesResponse.data);
};
```

### Educator View Enhanced
```typescript
// Uses unified API for all operations
const apiService = createUnifiedApiService('educator', educatorId);

// Fixed upload with AWS integration
const handleFileUpload = async (file: File, metadata: any) => {
  const response = await apiService.files.upload(formData);
  loadFiles(); // Refresh from AWS
};
```

### Admin View Enhanced
```typescript
// Simplified data loading with unified API
const loadData = async () => {
  const [usersResponse, filesResponse] = await Promise.all([
    apiService.users.getAll(),
    apiService.files.getAll(),
  ]);
  
  setUsers(usersResponse.data || []);
  setFiles(filesResponse.data || []);
};
```

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### AWS-First with Local Fallback
```typescript
try {
  // Try AWS first
  const response = await axios.get('https://ps30ghdj7f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/files');
  return response;
} catch (awsError) {
  console.warn('AWS not available, using local:', awsError);
  // Fallback to local API
  return this.apiClient.get('/files');
}
```

### Benefits:
- **Resilience**: System works even if AWS is down
- **Development**: Can develop locally without AWS dependencies
- **Migration**: Smooth transition between local and cloud storage
- **Debugging**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Data Flow Summary

### File Upload Flow
1. **Educator** selects file and lecturer from dropdown
2. **Client** sends to unified API service
3. **Service** tries AWS upload first
4. **AWS** stores file and returns metadata
5. **Local** backup created for admin oversight
6. **All Roles** see updated file list immediately

### File Access Flow
1. **Any Role** requests files
2. **Unified API** checks AWS first
3. **AWS** returns role-filtered data
4. **Client** displays appropriate files
5. **Local** fallback if AWS unavailable

### File Operations Flow
1. **Download/Delete** requested by authorized role
2. **AWS** processes operation
3. **Local** backup updated accordingly
4. **Success** confirmed to client
5. **UI** refreshed with updated data

## Testing Verification

### Functionality Verified:
✅ All roles access same AWS file data  
✅ Educator can select lecturer from dropdown
